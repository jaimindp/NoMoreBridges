@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":\"IERC20PermitUpgradeable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd60f939a3ca0199014d079b4dd66aa757954334947d81eb5c1d35d7a83061ab3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ce6e5ae4633559c2aad156be884a96f7a9beb8dd31b1b630a6de55972e3af622\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQasz4sQoexkrvB7wCQAY6NbMoCtPS7AqomymRoJGYz85\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol":{"SafeERC20Upgradeable":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"6080806040523460175760399081601c823930815050f35b5f80fdfe5f80fdfea2646970667358221220b4fff70822e4db7057c500d82d4b61715cebf99c8c35292ce4669c272a3fba4e64736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x39 SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1C DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xB4 SELFDESTRUCT 0xF7 ADDMOD 0x22 0xE4 0xDB PUSH17 0x57C500D82D4B61715CEBF99C8C35292CE4 PUSH7 0x9C272A3FBA4E64 PUSH20 0x6F6C634300081700330000000000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"734:6366:9:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"5f80fdfea2646970667358221220b4fff70822e4db7057c500d82d4b61715cebf99c8c35292ce4669c272a3fba4e64736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xB4 SELFDESTRUCT 0xF7 ADDMOD 0x22 0xE4 0xDB PUSH17 0x57C500D82D4B61715CEBF99C8C35292CE4 PUSH7 0x9C272A3FBA4E64 PUSH20 0x6F6C634300081700330000000000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"734:6366:9:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.23+commit.f704f362\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol\":\"IERC20Permit\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xec63854014a5b4f2b3290ab9103a21bdf902a508d0f41a8573fea49e98bf571a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://bc5b5dc12fbc4002f282eaa7a5f06d8310ed62c1c77c5770f6283e058454c39a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qme9rE2wS3yBuyJq9GgbmzbsBQsW2M2sVFqYYLw7bosGrv\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol":{"SafeERC20":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"6080806040523460175760399081601c823930815050f35b5f80fdfe5f80fdfea2646970667358221220ac30a48ddd72a5e947104adfca71916281bcdc843c6db810ba826762adef502764736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x39 SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1C DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xAC ADDRESS LOG4 DUP14 0xDD PUSH19 0xA5E947104ADFCA71916281BCDC843C6DB810BA DUP3 PUSH8 0x62ADEF502764736F PUSH13 0x63430008170033000000000000 ","sourceMap":"701:6234:19:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"5f80fdfea2646970667358221220ac30a48ddd72a5e947104adfca71916281bcdc843c6db810ba826762adef502764736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xAC ADDRESS LOG4 DUP14 0xDD PUSH19 0xA5E947104ADFCA71916281BCDC843C6DB810BA DUP3 PUSH8 0x62ADEF502764736F PUSH13 0x63430008170033000000000000 ","sourceMap":"701:6234:19:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.23+commit.f704f362\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).

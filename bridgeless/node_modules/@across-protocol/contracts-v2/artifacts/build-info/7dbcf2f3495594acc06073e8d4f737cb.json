@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

@notice Request to bridge input token cross chain to a destination chain and receive a specified amount\n of output tokens. The fee paid to relayers and the system should be captured in the spread between output\n amount and input amount when adjusted to be denominated in the input token. A relayer on the destination\n chain will send outputAmount of outputTokens to the recipient and receive inputTokens on a repayment\n chain of their choice. Therefore, the fee should account for destination fee transaction costs,\n the relayer's opportunity cost of capital while they wait to be refunded following an optimistic challenge\n window in the HubPool, and the system fee that they'll be charged.\n @dev On the destination chain, the hash of the deposit data will be used to uniquely identify this deposit, so\n modifying any params in it will result in a different hash and a different deposit. The hash will comprise\n all parameters to this function along with this chain's chainId(). Relayers are only refunded for filling\n deposits with deposit hashes that map exactly to the one emitted by this contract.\n @param depositor The account credited with the deposit who can request to \"speed up\" this deposit by modifying\n the output amount, recipient, and message.\n @param recipient The account receiving funds on the destination chain. Can be an EOA or a contract. If\n the output token is the wrapped native token for the chain, then the recipient will receive native token if\n an EOA or wrapped native token if a contract.\n @param inputToken The token pulled from the caller's account and locked into this contract to\n initiate the deposit. The equivalent of this token on the relayer's repayment chain of choice will be sent\n as a refund. If this is equal to the wrapped native token then the caller can optionally pass in native token as\n msg.value, as long as msg.value = inputTokenAmount.\n @param outputToken The token that the relayer will send to the recipient on the destination chain. Must be an\n ERC20.\n @param inputAmount The amount of input tokens to pull from the caller's account and lock into this contract.\n This amount will be sent to the relayer on their repayment chain of choice as a refund following an optimistic\n challenge window in the HubPool, less a system fee.\n @param outputAmount The amount of output tokens that the relayer will send to the recipient on the destination.\n @param destinationChainId The destination chain identifier. Must be enabled along with the input token\n as a valid deposit route from this spoke pool or this transaction will revert.\n @param exclusiveRelayer The relayer that will be exclusively allowed to fill this deposit before the\n exclusivity deadline timestamp. This must be a valid, non-zero address if the exclusivity deadline is\n greater than the current block.timestamp. If the exclusivity deadline is < currentTime, then this must be\n address(0), and vice versa if this is address(0).\n @param quoteTimestamp The HubPool timestamp that is used to determine the system fee paid by the depositor.\n  This must be set to some time between [currentTime - depositQuoteTimeBuffer, currentTime]\n where currentTime is block.timestamp on this chain or this transaction will revert.\n @param fillDeadline The deadline for the relayer to fill the deposit. After this destination chain timestamp,\n the fill will revert on the destination chain. Must be set between [currentTime, currentTime + fillDeadlineBuffer]\n where currentTime is block.timestamp on this chain or this transaction will revert.\n @param exclusivityDeadline The deadline for the exclusive relayer to fill the deposit. After this\n destination chain timestamp, anyone can fill this deposit on the destination chain.

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":\"IERC20PermitUpgradeable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20PermitUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd60f939a3ca0199014d079b4dd66aa757954334947d81eb5c1d35d7a83061ab3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ce6e5ae4633559c2aad156be884a96f7a9beb8dd31b1b630a6de55972e3af622\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQasz4sQoexkrvB7wCQAY6NbMoCtPS7AqomymRoJGYz85\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol":{"SafeERC20Upgradeable":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"6080806040523460175760399081601c823930815050f35b5f80fdfe5f80fdfea2646970667358221220b4fff70822e4db7057c500d82d4b61715cebf99c8c35292ce4669c272a3fba4e64736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x39 SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1C DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xB4 SELFDESTRUCT 0xF7 ADDMOD 0x22 0xE4 0xDB PUSH17 0x57C500D82D4B61715CEBF99C8C35292CE4 PUSH7 0x9C272A3FBA4E64 PUSH20 0x6F6C634300081700330000000000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"734:6366:9:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"5f80fdfea2646970667358221220b4fff70822e4db7057c500d82d4b61715cebf99c8c35292ce4669c272a3fba4e64736f6c63430008170033","opcodes":"PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xB4 SELFDESTRUCT 0xF7 ADDMOD 0x22 0xE4 0xDB PUSH17 0x57C500D82D4B61715CEBF99C8C35292CE4 PUSH7 0x9C272A3FBA4E64 PUSH20 0x6F6C634300081700330000000000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"734:6366:9:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.23+commit.f704f362\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).

/**
 * @dev Warning: this is a specialized function!! Its functionality is not obvious.
 * This function attempts to return block ranges to repeat ranges as much as possible. To do so, it may include blocks that
 * are outside the provided range. The guarantee is that it will always include _at least_ the blocks requested.
 * @param eventSearchConfig contains fromBlock, toBlock, and maxBlockLookBack.
 * The range is inclusive, so the results will include events in the fromBlock and in the toBlock.
 * maxBlockLookback defined the maximum number of blocks to search. Because the range is inclusive, the maximum diff
 * in the returned pairs is maxBlockLookBack - 1. This is a bit non-intuitive here, but this is meant so that this
 * parameter more closely aligns with the more commonly understood definition of a max query range that node providers
 * use.
 * @returns an array of disjoint fromBlock, toBlock ranges that should be queried. These cover at least the entire
 * input range, but can include blocks outside of the desired range, so results should be filtered. Results
 * are ordered from smallest to largest.
